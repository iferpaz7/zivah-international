# ZIVAH Website Enhancement - Technology Stack Update

## Overview

The .kiro specifications have been completely updated to use modern web technologies instead of the previous PHP + MySQL + cPanel stack.

## Technology Stack Changes

### Before (PHP Stack)
- **Backend**: PHP 8.1+ with MVC architecture
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0 on cPanel
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript + Bootstrap 5
- **Hosting**: cPanel/InterServer
- **Email**: PHPMailer with cPanel SMTP
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT + PHP sessions

### After (Next.js Stack)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ with App Router
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with Prisma ORM
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + Headless UI
- **Hosting**: Vercel (recommended) or VPS
- **Email**: Resend API or NodeMailer
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with JWT

## Key Benefits of New Stack

### Developer Experience
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration from database to UI
- **Modern Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky for code quality
- **Hot Reload**: Instant feedback during development
- **Built-in Optimization**: Automatic code splitting, image optimization

### Performance
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Better SEO and initial load times
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Ultra-fast page loads for static content
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Best of both worlds
- **Edge Functions**: Global performance optimization

### Scalability
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable, maintainable code
- **API Routes**: Clean separation of frontend and backend
- **Database Migrations**: Version-controlled schema changes
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with TailwindCSS
- **Modern UI Components**: Accessible, beautiful interfaces
- **Real-time Updates**: Server Components for dynamic data
- **Progressive Web App**: Offline functionality and app-like experience
